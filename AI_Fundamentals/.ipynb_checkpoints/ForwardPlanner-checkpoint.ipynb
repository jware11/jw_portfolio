    "In this assigment, you're going to implement a Forward Planner. What does that mean? If you look in your book, you will not find pseudocode for a forward planner. It just says \"use state space search\" but this is less than helpful and it's a bit more complicated than that. **(but please please do not try to implement STRIPS or GraphPlan...that is wrong).**\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, a forward planner takes the current state of the world $S_0$ and attempts to derive a plan, basically by Depth First Search. We have all the ingredients we said we would need in Module 1: states, actions, a transition function and a goal test. We have a set of predicates that describe a state (and therefore all possible states), we have actions and we have, at least, an implicit transition function: applying an action in a state causes the state to change as described by the add and delete lists.\n",

    "These will all need to be parsed from s-expressions to the underlying Python representation before you can use them. You might as well do it at the start of your algorithm, once. The order of the conditions is *not* arbitrary. It is much, much better for the unification and backtracking if you have the \"type\" predicates (item, place, agent) before the more complex ones. Trust me on this.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the algorithm itself, there is going to be an *outer* level of search and an *inner* level of search.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *outer* level of search that is exactly what I describe here: you have a state, you generate successor states by applying actions to the current state, you examine those successor states as we did at the first week of the semester and if one is the goal you stop, if you see a repeat state, you put it on the explored list (you should implement graph search not tree search). What could be simpler?\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out the Devil is in the details. There is an *inner* level of search hidden in \"you generate successor states by applying actions to the current state\". Where?\n",
    "\n",
    "How do you know if an action applies in a state? Only if the preconditions successfully unify with the current state. That seems easy enough...you check each predicate in the conditions to see if it unifies with the current state and if it does, you use the substitution list on the action, the add and delete lists and create the successor state based on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Except for one small problem...there may be more than one way to unify an action with the current state. You must essentially search for all successful unifications of the candidate action and the current state. This is where my question through the semester appliesm, \"how would you modify state space search to return all the paths to the goal?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Unification can be seen as state space search by trying to unify the first precondition with the current state, progressively working your way through the precondition list. If you fail at any point, you may need to backtrack because there might have been another unification of that predicate that would succeed. Similarly, as already mentioned, there may be more than one.\n",
    "\n",
    "So...by using unification and a properly defined <code>successors</code> function, you should be able to apply graph based search to the problem and return a \"path\" through the states from the initial state to the goal. You'll definitely want to use graph-based search since <code>( drive Me Store), (drive Me Home), (drive Me Store), (drive Me Home), (drive Me Store), (buy Me Store Drill), (drive Me Home)</code> is a valid plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your function should return the plan...a list of actions, fully instantiated, for the agent to do in order: [a1, a2, a3]. If you pass an extra intermediate=True parameter, it should also return the resulting state of each action: [s0, a1, s1, a2, s2, a3, s3].\n",

    "4/7/24: This one was certainly a struggle. I could not figure out how to iterate through various orders of states and preconditions. I spent too much time on that particular problem, and also could not figure out the recursive call to store each potential subsequent state. The messaging around having pseudocode but we shouldn't use it, and we have to figure out modifications... that also confused me and caused quite a bit of churn. I think I was able to figure out the balance of parsing / comparing / unifying strings, but ultimately struggled to build out / store a plan. I'm interested in any and all feedback you're able to provide! "
